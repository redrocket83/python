# Review Questions

# True/False

# 1. Programmer srarely define their own functions = False
# 2. A function can only be called at once place in a program = False
# 3. Information can be passed into a function through parameters = True
# 4. Every Python function returns some value = True (None is returned when no explicit value is provided)
# 5. In Python, some parameters are passed by reference = False. Page 195. Technically Python passes all parameters by value
# 6. In Python a function can return only one value = False. Page 203
# 7. Python functions can never modify a parameter = False. Page 193/198/199. Parameters are always passed by value. However if the actual parameter is a variable whose 
#    object is a mutable object like a list, then changes to the object will be visible to the other program.
# 8. One reason to use functions is to reduce code duplication = True.
# 9. Variables defined in a function are local to that function = True. Page 203. Formal parameters and other variables inside fucntion definitions are local to that 
#    function
# 10. It's a bad idea to define new functions if it makes a program longer = False. Although some programs look longer it makes it much easier for experienced programmers
      to understand

# Multiple Choice

# 1. The part of a program which uses a function is 
# 
# a) User
# b) Caller *
# c) Callee
# d) Statement

#2. A python function definition begins with
#
# a)
