# Review Questions

# Q1. The best way to write a program is to immediately type in some code and then debug it until it works. FALSE
#
# 1A. Ref Page 27/28. "Writing large programs is daunting challenge. It would be almost impossible without a systematic approach. The process of creating a program is often
#      broken down into stages according to the information that is produced in each phase."
#
# Q2. An algorithm can be written without using a programming language. TRUE
#
# A2. Ref Page 28. Analyse the problem, Determine specifications and what your program will do, Create a design. The main taks is to design the algorithm which will meet the 
#     specification. Ref Page 30. An algorithm can be written using Pseudocode which is just precise English for describing what a program does.
#
# Q3. Programs no longer require modification after they are written and de-bugged. FALSE
#
# A3. Ref Page 28. One of the processes for creating a program involves testing and debugging the program. Programs are highly likely to be modified again and again after being
#     created which in turn will need further testing and debugging.
#
# Q4. Python identifiers start with an underscore or a letter. TRUE
#
# A4. Ref Page 31. Python has rules about identifiers or names as they're also known by. Each identifier must begin with an underscore or a letter
#
# Q5. Keywords make good variable names. FALSE
#
# A5. Ref Page 31. Some identifiers are part of Python itself and should not be used as they have a completely different meaning or function.
#
# Q6. Expressions are built from literals, variables and operators. TRUE
#
# A6. Ref Page Page 32: "The simplest kind of expression is a literal." p.33 "A simple identifier can also be an expression. We use identifiers as variables to give names 
#     to values. When an identifier appears as an expression, its value is retrieved to provide a result for the expression. p.34 "More complex and interesting expressions 
#     can be constructed by combining simpler expressions with operators."
#
# Q7. In Python x = x + 1 is a legal expression. TRUE
#
# A7. Ref Page 37. A variable can be assigned many times and the current value of a variable can be used to update its value. See Figure 2.1 on Page 38.
#
# Q8. Python does not allow the input of multiple values within a single statement. FALSE
#
# A8. Ref Page 42. Simutaneous assignment can be used to get multiple values from a user in a single input. Example below
#
#     score1, score 2 = eval(input("Please enter 2 scores separated by a comma: "))
#
# Q9. A counted loop is designed to iterate a certain amount of times. TRUE
#
# A9. Ref Page 43/44. A definite loop will execute a definite number of times and is basically known as a counted loop
#
#     for i in range(10): for example
#
# Q10. In a flowchart, diamonds are used to show statement sequences and rectangles are used for decision points. FALSE
#
# A10. Ref Page 46/47. Diamonds are used for decision points and rectangles are use to assign the next item in the sequence
